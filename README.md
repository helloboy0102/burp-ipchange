# burp-ipchange
plugs extension of burp for ip changes,the same as python plugins fakeip,this only for intruder use.

mvn package (first use will load file file from apache site ,if you at mainland it will slow,so advice you use proxy by mvn)
this is change ip for burp work intruder,before this, i see fakeip,and recaptch plugs.that is good sense for me to make this plugin for burp,
it is so easy for everyone .
